# pyloo

ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

This is a Python implementation of the R package [loo](https://github.com/stan-dev/loo). This package intends to provide tools for Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV) and Pareto Smoothed Importance Sampling (PSIS) for Bayesian models in a framework agnostic way. 

Please note that this project is in its early stages and is in active development.

## Development Status

This package is currently being developed with a focus on:
- Implementing core LOO-CV and PSIS functionality
- Setting up proper testing infrastructure
- Creating comprehensive documentation
- Ensuring compatibility with popular Bayesian frameworks such as Arviz, PyStan, PyMC, etc.
