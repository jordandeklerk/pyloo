pyloo is an open source Python implementation of the R package [loo](https://github.com/stan-dev/loo).
This package intends to provide tools for Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV)
and Pareto Smoothed Importance Sampling (PSIS) for Bayesian models in a framework agnostic way.

Please note that this project is in its early stages and is in active development.
